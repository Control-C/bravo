        <h3>Bravo</h3>
        <p class="project-description">Bravo demonstrates how hospitals can use AI to build a privacy-first healthcare system that's efficient for doctors and delightful for patients.</p>
        <p>Using the Umbra privacy tool, the Bravo software streamlines a doctor's workflow during a patient consultation. A medical document to be sent to the patient's insurance company, personalized to the patient's conditions, is quickly generated using AI, without passing personally identifiable information about the patient to third party cloud services. At the same time, the same data is used to create a personalized story book about their illness for the young patient.</p>

        <h3>Umbra</h3>
        <p class="project-description">Umbra is a tool that prevents your private data from being shared to online services. It uses Gemini Nano to redact personal, sensitive, or confidential information on your local machine. Your redacted data is then sent off to Gemini cloud services for a response. When the response is received, Umbra replaces the redated data with the original texts.</p>
