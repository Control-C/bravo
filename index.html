    <h1>AI projects demo</h1>

    <p>Visit 2 proof-of-concept projects that use Gemini AI:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Tool:</strong> &lsquo;Umbra&rsquo; is a tool that redacts personally identifiable information on your
        local machine using Gemini Nano, before information is sent to Gemini cloud services.</li>
      <li><strong>Use case:</strong> &lsquo;Bravo&rsquo; shows an example of how the Umbra tool can be used, in the
        context of a hospital consultation.</li>
    </ol>

      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>Confirm that you are using the Chrome browser on a desktop computer (the demos are made for wide screens). If
        you are, then go to step 2.</p>

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>The demo projects need a key for the Google Gemini API. You can <a
          href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank">sign up for an API Key at Google (requires
          a Google account)</a></p>
      <p>If you don't have an API key, the demos will not work properly. Watch a pre-recorded <a
          href='https://youtu.be/cM4MuLyvaAE' target="_blank">video demo on You Tube</a> instead.</p>
      <form>
        <label for="apikey">Enter your API key:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="apikey" name="apikey" value="A valid Google Gemini API key"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">

        <h3>Umbra</h3>
        <p class="project-description">Umbra is a tool that prevents your private data from being shared to online
          services. It uses Gemini Nano to redact personal, sensitive, or confidential information on your local
          machine. Your redacted data is then sent off to Gemini cloud services for a response. When the response is
          received, Umbra replaces the redated data with the original texts.</p>

      <h3>Bravo</h3>
      <p class="project-description">Bravo demonstrates how hospitals can use AI to build a privacy-first healthcare
        system that's efficient for doctors and delightful for patients.</p>
      <p>Using the Umbra privacy tool, the Bravo software streamlines a doctor's workflow during a patient
        consultation. A medical document to be sent to the patient's insurance company, personalized to the patient's
        conditions, is quickly generated using AI, without passing personally identifiable information about the
        patient to third party cloud services. At the same time, the same data is used to create a personalized story
        book about their illness for the young patient.</p>
        <p><small>&lsquo;Bravo&rsquo; is a fictitious use case, but the scenario of a doctor using patient information to ask an LLM to write an insurance letter was created from a real-world incident (<a href="https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt" target="_blank">source</a>).</small></p>
